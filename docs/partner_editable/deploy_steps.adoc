=== Planning the deployment
This deployment is intended for IT security professionals and assumes familiarity with basic security concepts in the areas of networking, operating systems, data encryption, operational controls, and cloud computing. This guide includes an option to host the VPN and HSM components either on-premises or in a colocation site.

This Quick Start requires a moderate to high-level understanding of how to manage SWIFT security control requirements and compliance processes within a hosting environment. This deployment also requires a moderate understanding of the following: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[Service Quotas^], https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)^], and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html[AWS CloudFormation^].

The deployment process takes about {deployment_time} to complete, and the template launches in the {default_deployment_region} Region by default.

=== Launch the Quick Start
To deploy this Quick Start, use AWS CDK and Python. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-python.html[Working with the AWS CDK in Python].

AWS CDK allows you to use familiar programming tools and syntax to define infrastructure as code and to provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

. Ensure that you have the AWS CDK toolkit installed:

  npm install -g aws-cdk

. Verify the installation and check the current version:

  cdk --version 

. Deploy the resources defined in the SWIFT Connectivity stack:

  git clone https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-swift-digital-connectivity.git
  cd quickstart-swift-digital-connectivity
  
  . Install the application's dependencies:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

. Edit the `cdk.json` file to reflect your specific environment.

. Deploy the AWS CDK Toolkit stack (for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html[Bootstrapping^]):

  cdk bootstrap

. Deploy the CDK stack:

  cdk deploy
