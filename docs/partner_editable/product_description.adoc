This Quick Start was developed and tested using SWIFT components that are typical for most users. Detailed information for installation, configuration, and functionality can be found at https://www2.swift.com/knowledgecentre/productcategory[mySWIFT Knowledge Centre^] and through the https://www.swift.com/myswift[SWIFT account team^].

For this deployment, we used https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/interfaces-and-integration/swiftnet-link[SWIFTNet Link (SNL)^] to establish a connection to the SWIFT network using SNL release 7.5.00 on RHEL. The https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/interfaces-and-integration/alliance-gateway[Alliance Gateway (SAG)^] is the interface that connects via SNL and is installed on the same Amazon EC2 instance that runs version 7.5.00. https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/interfaces-and-integration/alliance-messaging-hub[Alliance Messaging Hub (AMH)^] was tested using release 4.1.2 on the RHEL platform.

In this deployment we also used a virtual private network (VPN) and Hardware Security Module (HSM). These components are VPN boxes ordered from SWIFT that are included in https://www.swift.com/our-solutions/interfaces-and-integration/alliance-connect/alliance-connect-bronze-silver-and-gold-packages#alliance-connect-bronze[SWIFTâ€™s Alliance Connect Bronze connectivity pack^] and the HSM security device.
